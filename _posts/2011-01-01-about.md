As a full stack engineer and founder, I love building products that bring people together.

Since 2006, I've used sports to bring people together with [PeacePlayers](http://www.peaceplayersintl.org), [DUPLAYS](https://duplays.com), and [Playpass](https://playpass.com).

Playpass makes life easier for managers of sports leagues and clubs. Our solutions: [league scheduler](https://playpass.com/sports-software/league-scheduler), payments, referrals, waivers, and website builder.

In 2013, I was named a ["high-impact entrepreneur"](http://www.endeavor.org/blog/28-high-impact-entrepreneurs-from-12-countries-join-the-endeavor-network-first-entrepreneurs-selected-from-miami-usa-morocco-and-uae/) by Endeavor Global.
  
I also [played basketball at Harvard](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2001/12/the-big-picture-16-2/) and as a pro in 4 countries.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin}}), [AngeList](https://angel.co/{{ site.author.angellist }}), and [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.author.angellist }}).
