Since 2006, I've used sports to bring people together with [PeacePlayers](http://www.peaceplayersintl.org), [DUPLAYS](https://duplays.com), and [Playpass](https://playpass.com).

Playpass makes life easier for managers of sports leagues and clubs. Playpass offers free [online registration](https://playpass.com/sports-software/online-registration) software, a sports [league schedule maker](https://playpass.com/sports-software/league-scheduler), a website builder, and more solutions for referrals and liability waivers.

In 2013, my co-founders at DUPLAYS and I were named ["high-impact entrepreneurs"](http://www.endeavor.org/blog/28-high-impact-entrepreneurs-from-12-countries-join-the-endeavor-network-first-entrepreneurs-selected-from-miami-usa-morocco-and-uae/) by Endeavor Global.

Since I'm often asked, I'm 6'10" (208cm). And yes, I [played basketball at Harvard](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2001/12/the-big-picture-16-2/) and as a pro in 4 countries.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.twitter }}), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/{{ site.author.facebook }}), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/{{ site.author.linkedin}}), and [AngeList](https://angel.co/{{ site.author.angellist }}).
