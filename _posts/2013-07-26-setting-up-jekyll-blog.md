##### After heading down a few different paths, cloning a working site worked best. Now I'm ready to customize a good-looking, working setup.

All thanks are due to [Garry Welding](https://github.com/gkwelding) who has an amazing blog post about [setting up Jekyll on GitHub Pages with Bootstrap](http://in-the-attic.com/2013/01/04/building-a-blog-using-jekyll-bootstrap-and-github-pages-a-beginners-guide/)

Prior to finding Gary's solution I went down a number of promising paths. All of which probably would be great, except that it was **much** faster to copy someone who had recently done the setup.

#### First attempts

- [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)
- [Yes We Jekyll](http://yeswejekyll.com/)
- I liked their suggestion to use [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) instead of [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

#### Next steps
- sleep, and then...
- Install [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
- Customize the CSS
- Learn more about [RDiscount](https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount) and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
- Learn about [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
