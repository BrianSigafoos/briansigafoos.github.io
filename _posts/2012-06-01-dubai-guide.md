###### Getting Around
- [Dubai Metro][] is cheap, easy and clean. Open 6am-11pm everyday except Fridays (2pm-12am) - don’t eat/drink on Metro or you’ll get fined! Tip: pay extra (1 time at least) to sit in front (Gold class) of the driverless train
Metro walkway: use  to cross Sheikh Zayed Road (highway) for Dubai Marina and JBR (beach)
- [Dubai Taxi][] call 04 208 0808 anytime for fast, great service to arrange a taxi pick-up
- [RTA Buses][] to other Emirates- 800 9090 for timetable / prices (Abu Dhabi E101 bus - see Abu Dhabi below)
