# briansigafoos.github.io

In August 2019, I changed this from Jekyll + basecss to Hugo + TailwindCSS.

Visit [github.com/BrianSigafoos/hugo_site](https://github.com/BrianSigafoos/hugo_site) for
the code that builds this GitHub page and is deployed to
https://briansigafoos.com.

*prior to August 2019*

## Workflow

- To publish on Github pages just merge a Pull Request into master and Github handles the rest.

```shell
# Local development
bundle install          # install jekyll and any dependencies
bunbdle exec jekyll serve --watch    # view site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

## Update 2017

- Replaced Bootstrap with [basscss](http://basscss.com/), removed tags, search and all Javascript

## Initial setup 2013

- Cloned a working Jekyll repo from [Garry Welding](https://github.com/gkwelding) who has an great blog post about [setting up Jekyll on GitHub Pages with Bootstrap](http://in-the-attic.com/2013/01/04/building-a-blog-using-jekyll-bootstrap-and-github-pages-a-beginners-guide/)
