## blog with Jekyll, Bootstrap and GitHub Pages

Setup was done quickly after following this *excellent* blog post on
[setting up a blog using Jekyll, Bootstrap](http://in-the-attic.com/2013/01/04/building-a-blog-using-jekyll-bootstrap-and-github-pages-a-beginners-guide/)

### Credits

- Start with clone of https://github.com/gkwelding/gkwelding.github.com and stripped out his posts and personal content
- Added [Alias Generator](https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator) after reading about [redirecting urls](http://rawsyntax.com/blog/blogging-on-jekyll-url-redirects/)
- Tags weren't working quite right without `tagbuild.sh` thanks to [copyninja](https://github.com/copyninja/copyninja.github.com/blob/master/tagbuild.sh)

### Todo

- Flat design, modify Bootstrap CSS
- Setup Octopress
