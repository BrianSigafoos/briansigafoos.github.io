## Workflow
* To publish on Github pages just merge a Pull Request into master and Github handles the rest.

        # Local development
        bundle install          # install jekyll and any dependencies
        jekyll serve --watch    # view site locally at http://127.0.0.1:4000
         
#### Todo
* [ ] SSL Certificate for https://
         
#### Update 2017

#### Initial setup 2013

* Cloned a working Jekyll repo from [Garry Welding](https://github.com/gkwelding) who has an great blog post about [setting up Jekyll on GitHub Pages with Bootstrap](http://in-the-attic.com/2013/01/04/building-a-blog-using-jekyll-bootstrap-and-github-pages-a-beginners-guide/)
